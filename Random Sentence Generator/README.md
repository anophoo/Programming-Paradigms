The Random Sentence Generator is a handy and marvelous piece of technology to create
random sentences from a structure known as a context-free grammar. A grammar is a
template that describes the various combinations of words that can be used to form
valid sentences. There are profoundly useful grammars available to generate extension
requests, generic Star Trek plots, your average James Bond movie, "Dear John" letters,
and more.
